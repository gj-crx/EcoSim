Hint0|Text]Welcome to the EcoSim, a game about simulating small artificial ecosystems. Every creature lives its own life here. Your only way to interfere simulated worlds in this game is to create a new different species.&
Hint1|Text]The typical life cycle of every creature consists of obtaining food, reproduction and protection of offspring. This is also the main actions that creatures perform in the game and you can see them right now.&
Hint2|Text]You can observe the life process of this simulation for a while, or just immediately start exploring the creature editor by clicking "Creatures" button.&
Hint9|Text]Let's spawn your new species and observe its life. Press the "Spawn creature" button to do it.&
Hint10|Text]If you are doing the missions you will have a goal indicator in the top right corner of the screen. Your current goal is to get six of your custom creatures alive at the same time.&
Hint11|Text]To achieve the goal, you should design a species  that will be able to survive and breed to the required amount. But in this tutorial you can just manually spawn creatures without limits to complete the task.&
Hint12|Text]Complete the mission objective to finish tutorial.&
Hint13|Text]You have successfully completed the tutorial. Now you can challenge missions or try the free play.&

Hint_Mission_0|Text]You need to introduce a new creature into this ecosystem. It should breed significantly and become the dominant species in this ecosystem.&
Hint_Mission_1|Text]Your current goal is to save the current ecosystem from imminent extinction. You must understand the cause of extinction and correct it by introducing a new species. Keep the population of all creatures above 22 for 20 seconds.&
Hint_Mission_2|Text]You must save life in this barren world. An extremely small amount of solar energy slows down the growth of plants. You need to keep the number of creatures above 10 for some time.&
Hint_Mission_3|Text]All you need to do is completely destroy this ecosystem. You must create a species that will lead to the complete extermination of life.&
Hint_Mission_4|Text]Most of the land is covered with water. You must create a species adapted to this ecosystem and reach the total number of creatures more than 22.&
Hint3|Text]This large tab allows you to design your own species. Let's quickly go through all the settings here.&
Hint4|Text]These settings allow you to modify health, hit damage, food searching distance, and the maximum lifespan of your creatures.&
Hint5|Text]It takes 1 point to increase any stats. Decreasing your creature's stats will also give you 1 point.&
Hint6|Text]You can also choose the type of your species. Land and marine species can only exist in their habitat. Amphibians can live both on water and land.&
Hint7|Text]Once you've completed creating the new species, click the "create" button. All your created species will be displayed in the panel on the right.&
Hint8|Text]Let's get back to the game and create your first custom species.&
